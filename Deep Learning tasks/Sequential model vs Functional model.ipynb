    "In the context of deep learning frameworks like Keras or TensorFlow, there are two primary ways to define and create neural network models: the Sequential model and the Functional model. Here's a comparison between the Sequential model and the Functional model:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequential Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Sequential model is a linear stack of layers, where each layer has a single input tensor and a single output tensor.\n",
    "- It is the simplest and most common way to build neural networks, especially for feedforward networks.\n",
    "- The model is created by adding layers one by one in a sequential manner.\n",
    "- It is suitable for building models with a straightforward architecture and a single input and output flow.\n",
    "- The Sequential model is easy to understand and implement, making it a good choice for beginners or when working with simple, sequential networks.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Functional model allows for more complex network architectures, including models with shared layers, multiple inputs, and multiple outputs.\n",
    "- It provides a more flexible and expressive way to define models, allowing for branching and merging of layers.\n",
    "- Instead of a linear stack of layers, the Functional model represents the network as a directed acyclic graph (DAG).\n",
    "- The model is created by explicitly defining the input and output tensors for each layer and connecting them accordingly.\n",
    "- The Functional model is suitable for building models with intricate architectures, such as multi-input/multi-output networks, residual networks, and models with skip connections.\n",
    "- It provides greater control and customization over the network structure, making it suitable for advanced use cases and researchers.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the Sequential model is a simple and straightforward way to build neural networks with a linear stack of layers, whereas the Functional model offers more flexibility and control over complex network architectures, allowing for shared layers, multiple inputs, multiple outputs, and more intricate connections between layers. The choice between the two models depends on the complexity of the network structure and the specific requirements of the problem at hand."
