    "A graph is a data structure you can use to model hierarchy and relationships between objects. It consists of a set of nodes and a set of edges. Nodes represent individual objects, while edges illustrate relationships between those objects.<br>\n",
    "If every edge in a graph illustrates a two-way connection, we call that graph undirected. On the other hand, if you can traverse each edge in only one direction, the graph is directed.<br>\n",
    "Not all nodes of a graph need to be connected with others. If you can access each node from any other node in a graph - we call that graph connected. But sometimes there are some nodes you can't access from any other node in a graph - that's what disconnected graphs are all about. The common misconception is that every graph has to be connected, but the reality of the matter is that it doesn't - in fact, a graph can contain no edges, just nodes:<br>\n",
    "From the implementation standpoint, the one last thing we need to cover is the weight of an edge. It is a numeric value assigned to the edge describing how much it costs to traverse that edge. The smaller the weight of an edge, the cheaper it is to traverse it. Based on that, graphs with weights assigned to their edges are called weighted graphs:<br>\n"
